              Basic program to programming large autonomous robots and
              eventually dealing with government networking infrastructure. I've

            </h3>
            <p>
              As a 2023 Fort Bend County IT Networking intern, I installed and
              managed a large new batch of in-car networking equipment and
              laptops for the Sheriff's Office division. I gained knowledge in
              <mark>Azure Active Directory</mark> / Microsoft Entra ID, handling
              authentication and access control. Additionally, I successfully
              managed Axon body camera software, ensuring
              <b>data integrity protocols</b>. Moreover, I explored Cradlepoint
              in-car routing, which optimizes
              <b
                >data communications and connectivity for patrol and crisis
                response vehicles</b
              >. This enriching experience strengthened my passion for IT
              networking and its potential to
              <b>positively impact public safety</b> and society.

            <p>
              As part of tamuHack 2023, a twenty-four hour Texas A&M hackathon,
              I and three other teammates created a
              <b>website and algorithm for sponsoring company CBRE</b> that
              sorts teams into office space based on each team's preferences and
              floor capacity. My role involved developing the website's user
              interface and linking
              <b>Microsoft Azure cloud services to host both it and the API</b>.
              Through this, I learned about the importance of designing a
              well-made software product that adhered to a business's
              requirements, and I learned how critical the "human factor" is in
              <b>marketing the product</b>.

            <p>
              During my time as a 2022
              <b>Fort Bend County IT Networking intern</b>, me and my fellow
              interns worked on the installation of Cisco phones, configuration
              of modern Cisco network switches, and wiring / troubleshooting hot
              ethernet ports at the Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The EOC
              is a brand-new always-online building for managing emergencies
              taking place in the county, from hurricanes to winter weather
              outages. During my time on the project, I learned an extensive
              amount about
              <b
                >Cisco switch configuration, enterprise-level firewalls,

            <p>
              During my time as a member of the Dulles Robotics organization, a
              <b><i>FIRST</i> Robotics participant</b>, I was responsible for
              leading both robot programming and website development. As part of
              the latter goal, I built, from the ground-up, a React-based
              website that
              <b>promotes our organization to potential sponsors</b>. This
              website utilizes React to its fullest and incorporates a
              self-hosted Express.js
              <b>API to show blog posts and real-time competition results.</b>
              By incorporating the API into chat application Discord, other
              robotics leaders can add media, blog posts, and more with ease. I
              continue to maintain and host the website/API even in 2023.

            <h3>Self-hosted Proxmox Server for Virtual Machines</h3>
            <p>
              Throughout quarantine I took up an interest in hosting my own
              websites and projects online. In this, I discovered the Linux
              distribution Proxmox, which
              <b>hosts virtual machines and containers</b> on a dedicated
              machine. Using an old machine of mine, I installed it and began by
              hosting a self-coded website using NGINX, an
              <b
                >HTTP/proxy server on a custom domain over the Cloudflare SSL
                layer</b
              >. Over time I‚Äôve added more capabilities to it, including a
              Database container, Website container (hosting this website among
              other projects), API container (servicing the Robotics website), a
              VPN for remote management, and several game servers. To this day,
              this project is very much <b>still in development</b>.
